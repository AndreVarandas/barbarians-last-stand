⚔️ Barbarian's Last Stand is a simple 2d Fighting game.

Play it on itch.io: [https://vvludum.itch.io/barbarians-last-stand](https://vvludum.itch.io/barbarians-last-stand)

## Development

Just open the project in Construct 3 and run it.

If you don't have Construct 3, you can download it here: [https://www.construct.net/en](https://www.construct.net/en)

It unfortunately requires a paid Construct 3 license to add more features, as it has reached the free version's limit - you can still run it and play it in the free version though.
